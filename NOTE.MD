Hello

To accomplish this task, I used the React library. Instead of bootstrap, I used the styles I just wrote by myself. If I had to give things that I could improve in my application, it would be:
- adding some proptypes or typescript
- adding unit tests and e2e
- adding library for styling (Bootstrap, styled-components, MaterialUI)
- add some library for monitoring size of bundle and some parts of application
- maybe separating some things into subcomponents
- add an element that would be responsible for informing the user about that the page is not working or a loader informing that the page is still loading with individual elements when it would take more time


I hope that you will enjoy the code app. The application itself doesn't have much functionality, but it does the job. :)
